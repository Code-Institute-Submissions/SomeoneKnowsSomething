# UX

## Project purpose

As a passionate book reader as well as a fan of all types of psychological and crime films/series I realized that due to family/work commitments I hadn't got much  time to concentrate on reading and watching TV but at the same time I used to spend roughly 2 - 2.5 hrs daily in the car - commuting. Although there is such a thing as audiobooks I found that podcast(better structured and in relatively short episodes) is a better choice. Podcasts gave me great opportunity of mixing business with pleasure.

Despite this I quickly realised that finding a good podcast was a challenge in itself. It meant scrolling through a podcast app, trying to listen to something only to realize after 1 episode that this wasn't the right thing. Another option was to search internet for top charts created by journalists for newpapers or web portals.

While the first option was very easy to navigate, after couple of uses suggested content was pretty much similar to what I have just finished. Second option was giving me the chance to broaden the content however it meant searching internet for mentioned titles.

This page recommends limited number of content to unregistered users however it gives opportunity for a register user to check another user's favourite podcasts and to see all content added by them split into 3 categories - depending on the podcast origin. It also gives registered user opportunity to access podcast website - via a button - and explore ways of listing to it directly from there.

### Site visitor goals

These goals are:

- Have somewhere to search for podcasts that they are interested in.
- Possibility of reading the plot details before listening to the podcast.
- Knowing that the page is dedicated to this genre and there will not be need of wasting time to find something interesting.

Another/possible goals might be:

- Direct access to podcast website.
- Possibility of listening to the podcast via links.
- Reaching podcats that are not too popular in users part of the world but that user might find interesting.
- Possibility of finding out who the producer is in order to search for similar content beyond this page.

Someone knows something - True Crime Podcast website is an ideal way to met all these goals as it:

- presents users with true crime podcasts,
- presents users with podcasts from USA, UK and Australia,
- allows users to read more about each podcast,
- allows users to access podcasts pages directly,

- allows users to easily access producters page to explore.
