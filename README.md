# UX

## Project purpose

As a passionate book reader I realized that due to family/work commitments I hadn't got much  time to concentrate on reading but at the same time I used to spend roughly 2 - 2.5 hrs daily in the car - commuting. Podcasts gave me great opportunity of mixing business with pleasure.

Despite this I quickly realised that finding good podcasts was challenge in itself. It meant scrolling through podcast apps, trying to listen to something only to realize after 1 episode that this wasn't the right thing. Another option was to search internet for top charts created by journalists for newpapers of web portals.

While the first option was easy to navigate, after couple of uses suggested content was pretty much similar to what I have just finished. Second option was giving me the chance to broaden the content however it meant searching internet for mentioned titles.

This page recommends limited number of content to unregistered users however it gives opportunity for a register user to check another user's favourite podcasts and to see all content added by them split into 3 categories - depending on the podcast origin. It also gives registered user opportunity to access podcast website - via Listen now button - and explore ways of listing to it directly from there.
