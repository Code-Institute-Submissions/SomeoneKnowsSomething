# UX

## Project purpose

As a passionate book reader as well as a fan of all types of psychological and crime films/series I realized that due to family/work commitments I hadn't got much  time to concentrate on reading and watching TV but at the same time I used to spend roughly 2 - 2.5 hrs daily in the car - commuting. Although there is such a thing as audiobooks I found that podcast(better structured and in relatively short episodes) is a better choice. Podcasts gave me great opportunity of mixing business with pleasure.

Despite this I quickly realised that finding a good podcast was a challenge in itself. It meant scrolling through a podcast app, trying to listen to something only to realize after 1 episode that this wasn't the right thing. Another option was to search internet for top charts created by journalists for newpapers or web portals.

While the first option was very easy to navigate, after couple of uses suggested content was pretty much similar to what I have just finished. Second option was giving me the chance to broaden the content however it meant searching internet for mentioned titles.

This page recommends limited number of content to unregistered users however it gives opportunity for a register user to check another user's favourite podcasts and to see all content added by them split into 3 categories - depending on the podcast origin. It also gives registered user opportunity to access podcast website - via a button - and explore ways of listing to it directly from there.

### Site visitor goals

These goals are:

- Have somewhere to search for podcasts that they are interested in.
- Possibility of reading the plot details before listening to the podcast.
- Knowing that the page is dedicated to this genre and there will not be need of wasting time to find something interesting.

Another/possible goals might be:

- Direct access to podcast website.
- Possibility of listening to the podcast via links.
- Reaching podcats that are not too popular in users part of the world but that user might find interesting.
- Possibility of finding out who the producer is in order to search for similar content beyond this page.

Someone knows something - True Crime Podcast website is an ideal way to met all these goals as it:

- presents users with true crime podcasts,
- presents users with podcasts from USA, UK and Australia,
- allows users to read more about each podcast,
- allows users to access podcasts pages directly,

## Design choices

</p>

### Color scheme

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pddrtdn/palette.png">

Colors that were picked had be subtle enough not to overwhelm colorful cards of the podcasts covers.

Yellow #fad201 and black #000000 were picked to be reminiscent of a tape "POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS".

Charcoal #36454f was picked as first thing that comes to mind when we think about crime is "gray" This color it is subtle and corresponds well with yellow and white as well as does not cause distraction for colorful podcasts covers.

Off yellow #ffffbf was picked to make forms stick out more but to be subtle enough to not overwhelm them.

Finally blue #5bc0de is a standard Bootstrap "info" class color that was used to differentiate between buttons when more than 1 is present or where there is a need for another color than yellow. It corresponds and compliments remaining colors well.

### Fonts

Font Roboto was picked as it is subtle and well known to many due to being default font for Android phones as well as Google services. It is clean and modern.

Oswald on the other hand, was picked as it displays good (in bold) on the yellow background. It stands out however it does not overwhelms.

### Logo - headline

"Someone Knows Something" - this sentence is the key one. I can risk to say that it appears in 95% of all crime books/films/series or podcasts. It is almost guaranteed that at some point, some character  related to the story will say it.

It was also noted by Canadian filmmaker and writer David Ridgen who crated 5 seasons of podcasts with the same name.

### Icons

This website - my account section - uses Font Awesome Icons to direct logged in user to add, listen to, edit or delete podcasts. It also displays an icon to allow user to acces password change section.
